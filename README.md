# Bulma Jumbo Tiny

[![MIT](https://img.shields.io/github/license/NF-Software-Inc/Bulma-Jumbo-Tiny)](https://github.com/NF-Software-Inc/Bulma-Jumbo-Tiny/blob/master/LICENSE)

This library is an extension to the [Bulma CSS Framework](https://bulma.io). 

The purpose of this library is to provide additional sizing options that are simple to use and work with the existing bulma tags.

This library adds the `is-tiny` and `is-jumbo` selectors to combine with the following bulma classes. Note that `is-tiny` and `is-jumbo` will take precedence over `is-small`, `is-medium`, and `is-large`.

* Components: `breadcrumb`, `message`, `pagination`, and `tabs`
* Elements: `button`, `delete`, `icon`, `progress`, `tag`, `title`, and `subtitle`
* Form: `file`, `label`, `input`, `select`, and `textarea`
* Helpers: `is-size-1` to `is-size-7`
* Layout: `hero` and `section`

Additionally, the `m-0` to `m-6`, `p-0` to `p-6` now include `-tiny` and `-jumbo` variants.

## Getting Started

These instuctions can be used to acquire and implement the library. Either copy the `bulma-jumbo-tiny.css` file in test\html\css to your project or include `index.sass` in your SASS build chain to import the library. Examples of usage can be found [here](index.html).
