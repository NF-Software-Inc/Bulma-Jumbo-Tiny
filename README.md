# Bulma Jumbo Tiny

This library is an extension to the [Bulma CSS Framework](https://bulma.io). 

The purpose of this library is to provide additional sizing options that are simple to use and work with the existing bulma tags.

This library adds the `is-tiny` and `is-jumbo` selectors to combine with the following bulma classes:

* Elements: `button`, `delete`, `icon`, `progress`, `title`, and `subtitle`
* Components: `message`
* Form: `label` and `input`
* Layout: `hero` and `section`
* Helpers: `m-0` to `m-6`, `p-0` to `p-6`, and `is-size-1` to `is-size-7`

Note that `is-tiny` and `is-jumbo` will take precedence over `is-small`, `is-medium`, and `is-large`.
